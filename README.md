# Data-Visualisation-By-Using-Tableaue
Aim: To analyze the Data of different Nations.

The Dataset contains information about different countries GDP,Life-expetency and Smartphone users.

The client is colour blind and requested to bear this in mind when building dashboard. The client is only interested in the top 20 highest ranking countries. All visuals should be for the top 20 highest ranking countries.

This is my first project using Tableaue. This is a clean dataset. So has a first step I have uploaded the data in Tableaue and created the relationship by mapping the common "Country" column.I have applied filters to make sure only top 20 ranked Countries are displayed. Created four charts for top 20 countries and tried one extra butterfly chart.

Conclusion: I have learnt different kinds of charts used for analysis and comparing different data for creating meaningfull visuals and also came to know the importance of different color palette for Analysis.
