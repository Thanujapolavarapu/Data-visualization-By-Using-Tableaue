# Data-visualization-By-Using-Tableaue

This is my first project using Tableaue. Here I was given "Wealth of Nations" Dataset, which includes three different datas.

The client is colour blind and requested to bear this in mind when building dashboard. The client is only interested in the top 20 highest ranking countries. All visuals should be for the top 20 highest ranking countries.

So has a first step I have uploaded the data in Tableaue and created the relationship by mapping the common Country column.I have applied filters to make sure only top 20 ranked Countries are displayed. Created four charts for top 20 countries and tried one extra butterfly chart.
